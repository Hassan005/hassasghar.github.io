### Thinking about your Audience

So for this week, I would be writing about how I got free hosting for my blog posts.
 I searched on the internet about, how to host my blog directly to my domain name but I could not find a proper way to do that.
 I purchased a domain from **Godaddy**. It does not cost more than 3$-5$.
 I tried hosting my domain to **WordPress** and **000webhost** but they were charging 35$ to 40$ for a year. As Outreachy also recommends using open-source tools, so I skipped them and found a blog shared by my mentors which was hosted on Gatsby. I explored the Gatsby website and found that it allows you to host Github pages for free. You can host up to 3 static websites for free on Gatsby.
 Also, Gatsby offers free starter packs that you can clone on your environments and start adding the content. 
 As my purpose was to write blogs for my internship, I choose their blogger template and cloned them in my local envirnment.
 Then after adding content, you will need to push that content to your Github, so Gatsby can pick that content and deploy it on your domain name.
 For that, you would need to name your repository with a github.io extension at the end and upload your code in that repository, for example, **hassan.github.io**. Then you browse **https://www.gatsbyjs.com/** and create your free account on Gatsby. Click to add a site, and then connect the GitHub repository you just created.
 After GitHub is connected, you need to add your domain name by clicking **Add Domain** button and then adding a domain. Also, you have to do the DNS transfers on your domain host to the Gatsby cloud. Finally, your domain is connected to Gatsby cloud hosting, now each content that will go to GitHub will be directly reflected on your website.

 see you :)
